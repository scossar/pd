#X text 45 107 Hey \, you downloaded the 'cylone' library from 'deken' \, nice! This library comes with separate binaries and a sub library. You need to add its path to your search paths and you should also load the 'cyclone' binary as a library \, which will give you some information on the terminal and install a subset of non-alphanumeric objects. You can also do this by creating the [cyclone] external as below., f 58;
#X text 68 349 To use the browser plugin \, right click on an empty space on the patch canvas and check entry menus for 'cyclone' \, which will allow you to choose and add the desired object in the spot you right clicked on., f 52;
#X text 55 436 Note: - If you already had an earlier version of Cyclone installed when you downloaded this version \, you have to restart Pure Data for some changes to take effect!!!;
